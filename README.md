# PIE_meteo
This is the repository of PIE 43
It is divided in 2 folders:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The folder *data_correlation* is designed to answer livrable 1. We show a relation between the potential temperature and the geopotential height. The data is explored and analyzed in a Jupyter notebook.
	\item The folder *filament_simulation* hosts our numerical code and its simulation cases to answer livrable 2 and 3.
\end{itemize}
